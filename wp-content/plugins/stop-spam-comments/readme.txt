This plugin is now also translated in: Italian. Translation help is welcome.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the Wordpress `/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Done!

There is also an option in the 'Setting' > 'Discussion' menu that let you keep the blocked comments in the WordPress backend spam queue. But please note that since they are stored in the DB, if your website gets lots of spam it may affect your server load.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= I activated the plugin but cannot see any changes on my website =
The plugin is invisible by design. But once you activate it, hopefully you will have no more comments by spambots.

= Does this plugin work in browsers with Javascript disabled? =
Yes, but users with Javascript disabled (maybe <0.1% of total) will see a notice to add a special key code along their comment.

= So not only spam messages won't post, but noone can post any comment =
Please, be sure your theme is using the proper `comment_form()` template function for displaying comments. For more see [this thread](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/comments-wont-post-2).
