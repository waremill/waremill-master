Disable the user notification email that is sent to the user, with a password reset link, after registration.

== Description ==

Since WordPress 4.3, a strong email is automatically created for a user while registering a new user. However, the user will receive an email, with a password reset link, after registration.

Not everyone wants that email to be sent out - so this plugin does one thing - Stops registration emails from being sent out.
